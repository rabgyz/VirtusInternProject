# VirtusInternProject

To run a Docker container with simple HTML page, please just:
  - clone this Github repository to your local disc
  - run command line
  - go to repo's folder
  - run terraform init
  - run terraform apply

Do you know any tools that can be used instead of Docker to build and run containers?
Yes, i know that Docker Compose allows to make multi-container apps, also know how to configure Docker Swarm.

Do you know other Infrastructure as Code technologies? What are the things you like and donâ€™t like in Terraform?
Like I mentioned - I don't know much about Terraform, but right now, after 5 hours spent on this project, i'm really curious about what else can be done with that tool.
I know something about Azure IaaS services like Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Resource Manager or Security Center - we are talking about this services in studies.
I also made one project in Heroku, using PostgreSQL Database.

How would you deploy this sample hello world project in Kubernetes using Terraform instead of running this locally on your machine?
I heard about Kubernetes (this is service similar to Docker) but i didn't use it instead. I made one training (without certificate) how to work with Docker and the first thing that came to my mind was: If I know Docker, why should I learn anything about Kubernetes? :) But now I realised that it's nice to have knowledge about Kubernetes AND Docker.
